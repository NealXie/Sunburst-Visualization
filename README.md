# Sunburst Visualization  
Sunburst visualization helps track population changes from initial channels over lifecycles e.g. digital channels, sites and publishers.  

This is a interactive visualization to measure digital attribution. This App can organize the code base and draw the D3 components from a single HTML <code>div</code> tag, and to dynamically assign color and legend scales.  

Another advantage of this App is generalizing and conventionalizing data inputs. The input requires a simple tabular schema of <code>sequence, value</code> (see below) and the program will parse the data into a JSON graph.  

The design of the data imput therefore makes the visualization more useable on relational database queries. The CSV data can be unsorted but it must <em>NOT</em> contain a header, and has to conform to the following data column requiorements.
